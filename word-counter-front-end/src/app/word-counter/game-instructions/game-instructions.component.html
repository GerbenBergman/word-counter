    Welcome to the word counting game. During this game you are challenged to form three sentences which should
    meet certain specifications.
    These specifications are different for each sentence and are displayed above the input box in which you
    should enter your sentence. In this game,
    words are considered to contain only alphabetical characters, which means the following examples are not
    considered words:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>'continue,'</li>
    <li>'end.'</li>
    <li>'combined-word'</li>
    <li>'caf√©'</li>
</ul>

<p>Both upper- and uderscore characters are allowed.</p>
