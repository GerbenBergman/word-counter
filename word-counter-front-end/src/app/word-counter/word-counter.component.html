    <h1>Word Counter</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the word counting game. During this game you are challenged to form three sentences which should meet certain specifications.
        These specifications are different for each sentence and are displayed above the input box in which you should enter your sentence. In this game,
        words are considered to contain only alphabetical characters, which means the following examples are not considered words: 
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>'continue,'</li>
        <li>'end.'</li>
        <li>'combined-word'</li>
